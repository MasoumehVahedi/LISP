# SPLindex

## Introduntion

This paper proposes SPLindex, a Spatial Polygon Learned Index, designed for disk-based systems. To achieve this, SPLindex is based on four main ideas: 1) dividing polygons into clusters, 2) mapping clusters to one-dimensional ordering using Z-address, 3) a hierarchical model that predicts cluster IDs for a given spatial queries, and 4) locating polygons on disk layout and accessing via a table for optimal disk access.

## Highlights
1- Spatial object clustering 

2- Ranking clusters by $Z$-addresses

3- The Hierarchical $Z$-Interval Tree (HZIT)
